# People Counting System Readme

## Overview

This Python-based People Counting System employs AI and ML techniques, utilizing computer vision libraries like OpenCV and TensorFlow. It detects and counts individuals in images or videos.

## Features

- **Object Detection:** Uses pre-trained models to detect people in images or video frames.
- **Counting Algorithm:** Utilizes algorithms to accurately count the number of people present.
- **Real-time Processing:** Supports real-time processing for live video feeds.
- **Python Implementation:** Entirely written in Python, leveraging OpenCV and TensorFlow libraries.
